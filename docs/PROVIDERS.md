# Provider admission

`models.dev` is a candidate metadata source, not rx's runtime source of truth.
Admission lives in `data/provider-admission.json`. Running
`scripts/update-rx-providers` writes `data/providers.json`.
Both files are committed. Released rx binaries compile `providers.json` in and
never fetch `models.dev`. The generated list is the first admitted models.dev
ID, then the first managed entry, then the remaining models.dev IDs, then the
remaining managed entries. When every models.dev model on an admitted provider
shares one `limit.context`, that value is stored as `default_context` and used
if live `GET /v1/models` omits a window. OpenAI roots that already end in `/vN`
(Z.AI `/paas/v4`) are left as-is.

Protocol-scoped model controls live in the admission file's
`model_capabilities` map and are copied into the bundled snapshot. The key is
provider ID, normalized endpoint, model ID, and protocol. Live `GET /v1/models`
only filters which models are currently available. A matching bundled entry
may declare reasoning as `fixed` or list the selectable effort IDs and their
wire values. Missing data stays unknown and is not inferred from a model name.
Overriding a bundled provider's endpoint disables its bundled model
capabilities and falls back to `openai-completions`. A bundled provider may set
`dsh_protocol` for its verified agent path: `openai-responses` when its Chat
Completions tool path does not support selectable effort while Responses
accepts `reasoning.effort`. Capabilities remain separate per protocol.

Users manage providers with `rx providers list`, `login [provider]`,
`logout [provider]`, `use [provider]`, and `models update [provider]`. Passing a
provider ID skips the picker; `use` persistently selects the default provider. The one-launch form
`rx --provider <provider> <harness>` overrides it. The `rx` harness picker offers the
same one-launch override: `tab` lists the configured providers, and the selection
applies to that launch without changing `default_provider`. `none` skips injection for one
launch (`rx --provider none <harness>`) or persistently (`rx providers use none`)
and overrides the implicit OpenRouter default. Custom providers are configured
with `default_provider` plus `[provider.<id>]` entries in `~/.recall/rx.toml`.
Stored API keys live in `~/.recall/rx.keys`; `auth = "env"` reads the provider's
configured environment variable instead. A stored key whose provider no longer
resolves — one dropped from the bundled catalog, or a `[provider.<id>]` entry
without `base_url` — stays listed under a `!` marker and accepts only `logout`,
so the key never becomes unreachable.

A provider may enter the bundled provider catalog only after
`scripts/probe-rx-provider` confirms all of these contracts through
one API key (OpenAI `endpoint`, plus optional `anthropic_base` for Messages):

- OpenAI `GET /v1/models` (`data[].id`).
- OpenAI-compatible `POST /v1/chat/completions` as SSE.
- Codex/Pi `POST /v1/responses` as SSE.
- Claude Code `POST /v1/messages` as SSE.

The probe and launch path only request standard `GET /v1/models`. At launch, rx writes per-provider
catalog files under `~/.recall/catalogs/` (Codex `model_catalog_json` as a
Codex `ModelInfo` document, Claude picker seed, OpenCode/Pi model maps). Fresh
files for the same provider and endpoint are reused for 1 hour.
`rx providers models update [provider]` fetches again and rewrites those files.
Claude then merges that provider's seed into `.claude.json`.
Passing only the `models.dev` `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` classification is not
enough. After the probe prints `ADMIT`, add the models.dev ID (or a managed
entry) to `data/provider-admission.json`, run
`scripts/update-rx-providers`, and commit both data files.
Reasoning capability entries additionally require a request-level probe for
each declared wire value on the exact protocol. A fixed entry requires
evidence that the protocol has no selectable control; another protocol's
support does not qualify.

```sh
RX_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.example.com/v1 \
RX_PROVIDER_KEY=sk-... \
scripts/probe-rx-provider
```

If Claude Messages lives on a different origin, pass `--anthropic-base` or
`RX_PROVIDER_ANTHROPIC_BASE`. After `ADMIT`, add that URL to the admission
`anthropic_base` map for the provider ID. If models.dev's `api` is the
Anthropic origin (MiniMax), also set `endpoint` to the OpenAI `/v1` URL.

Custom providers remain user-managed and default to an OpenAI-compatible `/v1`
endpoint. If Claude Code needs a separate Anthropic-compatible origin, set
`anthropic_base` on the provider (admission `anthropic_base` map, bundled
`providers.json`, or `[provider.<id>] anthropic_base` in `rx.toml`). Codex,
OpenCode, and Pi still use `endpoint`. Their compatibility is the user's
responsibility and does not lower the bundled catalog admission bar.
