# Hosting rx

How to embed the `rx` launcher inside another CLI and route coding agents
through your own gateway. This is the practice extracted from the first
production embedder (tokener-cli, Go); the contract itself lives in
`src/host.rs` and is verified by `cargo test -p rx`.

## The contract

`rx host` is the only supported embedding surface. Everything else — config
files, provider catalogs, key files — is end-user
surface and must not be scripted by a host.

Handshake (no request environment set):

```
$ rx host
{"protocol":{"major":1,"minor":1},"version":"0.1.0","harnesses":["claude","codex","opencode","pi","dsh","kimi"]}
```

Launch: `rx host -- <native harness args>` with two environment variables:

- `RX_HOST_REQUEST` — a JSON request (schema below).
- The credential variable named by `gateway.credential_env`, holding the
  gateway API key.

```json
{
  "harness": "codex",
  "gateway": {
    "provider_id": "tokener",
    "name": "Tokener",
    "endpoint": "https://api.tokener.ai/v1",
    "credential_env": "TOKENER_API_KEY"
  },
  "state_dir": "/abs/path/owned/by/host",
  "install_policy": "prompt"
}
```

Rules the request must satisfy — rx rejects violations instead of guessing:

- Unknown fields are rejected (`deny_unknown_fields`). Never add fields
  without a protocol version bump on the rx side.
- `state_dir` must be absolute. rx keeps its own runtime state (catalog
  cache) under it. Harness homes are never redirected: hosted sessions see
  the user's own harness configuration (skills, agents, settings), exactly
  like a native launch. Protocol minor 1 marks this semantic; before it,
  rx scoped harness homes under `state_dir`.
- `harness` is optional; when omitted, rx shows its interactive picker.
- `install_policy` is `prompt` or `deny`.
- The endpoint must be an HTTP(S) URL; `credential_env` must be a valid
  environment variable name.

What rx guarantees in return:

- Route guards per harness: native flags that could reroute traffic off the
  gateway (`--settings`, `model_provider=...`, non-gateway `--model`
  scopes, `--api-key`, ...) are rejected before launch. Hosts must not
  reimplement or pre-filter these — pass native args through verbatim and
  let rx be the authority.
- Discovery/installation of the harness binary uses the user-owned harness
  home; hosted state is rx-internal runtime state only, never an
  installation root.
- `rx host` plans what `rx` / `rxc` plan. For the same harness, native
  args and environment, a hosted launch gets the same launch-scoped
  injection (flags and child environment) as a native one, max-permission
  injection included; `RX_NO_YOLO` and a user-supplied permission flag
  disable it exactly as they do natively. The request has no permission
  knob because the host makes no permission decision. User harness
  configuration stays visible and is never rewritten beyond marker-owned
  catalog entries; the gateway route is enforced by injection precedence
  plus the route guards above.
- The key is read from the environment and injected into the launch plan;
  it never appears in argv.

## Distribution: pin, verify, refresh by PR

Do not fetch rx at runtime and do not shell out to whatever `rx` is on
`PATH`. Embed per-platform release binaries in your own binary and treat
the pair (binaries, lock file) as one atomically reviewed unit.

Commit a lock next to the assets recording, per target:

- source: repository, ref, full 40-char revision, rx version
- build: Rust toolchain, provenance URL of the CI run that built it
- artifact: repo-relative path and SHA-256

Validate the lock strictly on load (schema number, full-SHA and digest
patterns, exact target set, unknown fields rejected) and make your test
suite verify that the committed binaries match the committed digests, so a
half-updated snapshot cannot pass CI.

Refresh through a dedicated CI workflow, not by hand:

1. Resolve the requested upstream ref to a revision whose CI gate is
   green; refuse otherwise.
2. Build `cargo build --locked --release -p rx` on native runners per
   target with a pinned toolchain.
3. Probe each built artifact on its own platform: run `rx host` and assert
   protocol major/minor, the expected rx version, and the exact harness
   set. A binary that builds but fails the handshake never lands.
4. Regenerate the lock, run the host repo's full gate, and open a PR
   containing exactly the four binaries plus the lock. Never push to the
   default branch directly; the PR diff of the lock file is the human
   review surface for "what did we just ship".

## Runtime: verify before exec

The embedded bytes are data until proven otherwise:

1. Check the embedded target matches the running OS/arch (a cross-compiled
   host binary can carry the wrong asset).
2. Hash the embedded bytes and compare against the lock digest compiled
   into the same binary.
3. Extract to a content-addressed cache path (`.../engines/<sha256>/rx`)
   with 0700 permissions, via temp file + atomic rename, and re-verify the
   on-disk file after install and on every reuse. Content addressing makes
   upgrades and concurrent versions collision-free with no cleanup
   protocol.
4. `exec` the engine, replacing the host process, with an environment
   scrubbed of any stale `RX_HOST_REQUEST` and credential variable before
   setting the fresh values.

Offer a development escape hatch (tokener uses `TOKENER_RX=<abs path>`)
but hold it to the same bar: require an absolute path and run the `rx
host` handshake against it, asserting protocol compatibility and that it
supports the harness about to launch, before trusting it.

## Boundaries

- rx is the routing authority; the host owns key lifecycle, gateway
  endpoint, and UX around them.
- Do not link rx's crates or parse its internals — the capabilities JSON
  and the request schema are the whole contract.
- Gate on `protocol.major == 1` and treat minor as additive.
- Keep the credential out of argv, logs, and host config files it does not
  already own.

## Embedder checklist

- [ ] `rx host` handshake asserted in CI for every shipped artifact
- [ ] Lock file with revision, toolchain, provenance, per-target SHA-256
- [ ] Strict lock validation + digest test wired into the host repo gate
- [ ] Refresh workflow: green upstream revision → native builds → probe →
      PR
- [ ] Runtime digest verification before extraction and before every exec
- [ ] Content-addressed engine cache, 0700, atomic install
- [ ] Environment scrubbed before injecting request + credential
- [ ] Override path validated with the same handshake
- [ ] Native args passed through untouched; route guards left to rx
